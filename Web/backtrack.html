     <h1>What is a backing track?</h1>
     <p>Backing tracks are a recorded musical accompaniment tool, usually consisting of 
      only the rhythm secion, or instrumental recordings of songs 
      excluding specific instruments, so that musicians can play along to with that
      specific instrument. In this instant, many backing tracks for guitars involve
      the drums, bass, and piano to accompany for guitarists to play along, and some cases,
      also the vocals if the song is a specific song and not a repeating chord progression.
     </p>
     <p>Here are many sources on youtube you can find your backing tracks on:
     </p>
     <p><a href="https://youtube.com/@sebastienzunino?si=uLZTeH2v_4Eyt1vm">Sebastien Zunino</a>: Youtube channel primarily sharing
      backing tracks for improvisation on different genres and moods such as blues, latin groove, funk, and so much more! 
    <br>
      <a href="https://youtube.com/@t-guitar?si=Jq3rCckMAFuZpWR5">TGuitar</a>: Youtube channel consisting of mainly improvisation
      backing tracks for the pop rock genre. If you are practising more pop rock solos, this
      channel is useful for you!
    <br>
      <a href="https://youtube.com/@guitareimprovisation?si=m2_XVOPwCIqGn0zX">Guitar Improvisation</a>: A youtube channel consisting of 
      backing tracks for jazz standards, but also just simple jazz progression backing tracks. This 
      channel is useful for people learning jazz guitar, and learning how to improvise through specific loved standards in 
      different tempos and speeds to match your learning pace, 
      or just for jamming in general, if using chord progression charts.
    <br>
      <a href="https://youtube.com/@ebtracks?si=0pg3LDk1_oFwsj4y">EssentialBackingTracks</a>: Youtube channel that shares
      smooth, soul, jam tracks in different keys, different progressions and slow to fast tempo 
      for easy practice.
    <br>
      <a href="https://youtube.com/@samuraijamtracks?si=mhQBfW8UYkuuN5A9">Samurai Jam Tracks</a>: Youtube channel that
      shares neo soul, city pop, jazz fusion, soul rnb, and much more jazz fusion-genred backing tracks
      in different keys. This account is really useful in terms of finding different voicing (ways to play the 
      same chord), as it displays on the screen, as well as the fretboard's scale overview to improvise over, 
      making it easy for self practice and revision.
    <br>
    <br>
     There are so many more backing tracks available on youtube, and also online. To find the backing track 
     of a song you wish to play, searching it up on youtube then adding 'backing track' at the end usually can 
     give you great results.
