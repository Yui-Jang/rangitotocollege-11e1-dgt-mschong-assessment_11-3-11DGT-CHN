     <h1>What are markings in music/ sheet music?</h1>
     <p>Markings are symbols and instructions on sheet music, commonly written underneath or above the 
      stave (the 5 lines/ 6 lines in tablature). This is one of the fundamentals to learning 
      the guitar, so you can understand when reading sheet music, the queues to be louder, quieter, 
      slower, and so much more different playing styles. Music markings and symbols are what manipulate
      and shape our music, to sound more humanely!

     <h1 id="dynamics">1. Dynamics</h1>
     <p>Dynamics in music, is the variation in the loudness of a song. They can change between 
      parts of songs, and have symbols to signify when on the music.
      <br>
      The dynamic <strong>f</strong>, is a shortened italian term for 'forte', deriving from the latin term 'fortis' (loud).
      As expected from the latin word, f means to play loud! But if the composer or sheet music wants you to play louder 
      than f, there will be more fs (ff, fff, ffff, even fffff!). These in order, are named fortissimo, fortississimo, fortissississimo, and fortississississimo! 
      The possibilities in range are endless ☆ ☺
      <br>
      The dynamic <strong>p</strong>, is a shortened italian term for 'piano', which means soft, or quiet. 
      Essentially, this dynamic on the page tells you to be quiet! Quieter terms go the same like forte. p, pp, ppp, which 
      stand for piano, pianissimo, and pianississimo.
      <br>
      The dyanmic <strong>mf</strong> or <strong>mp</strong>, means 'mezzoforte' and 'mezzopiano'. 'mezzo', 
      an italian term meaning medium or moderate, signifies that mf means 'moderately loud', and mp means 
      'moderately quiet'. Dynamics with mezzo give a more specific range in dynamics, allowing composers 
      to be free with their intentions and choices.
      <br>
      There are many more such as sfz (sforzando - a sudden emphasis on a note), or fp (fortepiano- loudly then immediately softly),
      however the terms p, f, and mf/mp are the fundamentals to reading sheet music markings.

      <h1 id="articulation">2. Articulation</h1>
      <p>
      Articulations are symbols in music that determine how its played, usually affecting its 
    pitch and duration of it.
    <br>
    The articulation 'staccato', is a dot directly above a note value. this means that the note should be 
    played short, and sharp and not elongated. However, this can also have different variations 
    such as 'staccatissimo', which means to play even shorter and even sharper! ☻
    <br>
    'Tenuto', is an articulation that instructs to hold the full value of the note, or sometimes longer.
    Tenuto has a symbol of a long dash above the note value. Sometimes people call the feeling of this articulation, 
    'leaning' on the note! 
    <br>
    A 'Fermata', is an articulation that instructs when written about a rest or note, that it should be 
    held longer than intended. Many people call this a pause, and it calls for more free pausing for the 
    musician to choose themself, or in orchestral context, the conductor's freedom. Fermatas are 
    written over notes or rests, and looks like a dot, and a half circle curve above the dot.
    <br>
    An 'Accent', is simply an accent, written over notes, and look like a sideward arrow. This 
    means to excentuate or emphasise the note, in its original note value. Accents sometimes are used 
    to manipulate the base rhythm, or to give an implication to certain genres like bossa nova, and 
    samba which are genres with intended specific accents at places.
    <br>
    And of course, there are many more than this. Articulation help can be found on
