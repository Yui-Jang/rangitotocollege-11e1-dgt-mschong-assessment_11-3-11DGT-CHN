      <h1>What are chords?</h1>
      <p> Chords are one of the fundamental, most important things to learn 
        when learning gutiar for the first time. Chords are groups of notes played
        together, sometimes becoming the base of the song. Due to the guitar's distinct
        6-string feature (normally 6 strings, it can be more or less), chords are easier
        to play than any other instrument as all 6 strings can be strummed at the same time 
        to play a chord. 
      </p>
      <h1>How to read chord charts</h1>
      <p>
      Chord charts are a visual and symbolic tool frequently used between guitarists.
      These chord charts are simple pictures, symbolising a visual map of 
      the fretboard and 6 strings, where the most left string is the 6th string (thickest), and 
      the most right string is the 1st string (the thinnest string).
      <br>
      On chord charts and on the diagram, there are dots at specific places, and the chord name 
      above the chart. The dots signify where you should put your fingers/ which strings and which 
      frets you should press, to strum and play that chord. Sometimes above the diagram of the fretboard,
      there is an X or O above specific strings. An X above a specific string means to not strum that 
      string when playing the chord, and the O, signifies that you are allowed to play that string 
      when playing the note. When there is no O nor X, this means you should be playing it either way.
    <br>
    <br>

      A D chord in this instance, means that you need to press the 1st string, 2nd fret,
      2nd string, 3rd fret, and the 3rd string, 2nd fret. The O above the 4th string indicates 
      that you should play it in the chord even though you don't press it, and the 5th and 6th string 
      signed with a X means that you should not play them in this chord. If you strum the overall 
      chord from the 4th string and down, success! You have played the D chord ☻
      <br>
      There are many other chords, and some chords even go out of the range of the first, second, and 
      third fret! This is usually indicated with words on the side, saying the space that seems like the 
      first fret is actually the third fret and the fretboard visually is shifted up, but just cut off the same 
      length.
