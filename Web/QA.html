            A : Guitar is an instrument that some people may find hard, or some people may find easy. There is a lot of 
            advantage in people with larger, or flexible hands. But that does not mean that you should not decide to play. 
            As we say, anyone can play guitar! Even with smaller or stiff hands, with enough practice can bring improvment, 
            and more flexibility. So therefore, guitar could be hard for some people. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't try 
            learn it!

        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>
            A : To learn and develop in a short period of time, <strong>consistency is key!</strong> Even if it is not daily,
          trying to practice a good amount, even 20 to 30 minutes frequently 2-5 times a week is recommended. In the beginner stage,
        if you are not consistent enough, the callouses may form and disappear really quickly. As time goes, even with little practice
      some people find it easier to pick up and refresh. Not everybody though! Be consistent and smart! </p>

        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>
            A : The guitar community is very welcoming in many aspects, being inclusive for curious beginners wanting to learn more, 
            or deep conversations of advanced guitarists. A way you can get involved is attending to 
            live music events, such as gigs and jams, and meet with the people on the scene. Many are free 
            and happy to have a chat with you if you have questions, or just genuinely want to have fun and create bonds!
            Joining bands, hosting jams, and in online platforms, sharing your music online is a great
            way to start chats, conversations, or even lead to more jams and play sessions!

        <button aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">Q: How much cost is needed to be involved in guitar (lessons, guitar costs, maintenance)</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>
            A : Lessons are great to learn quick and guided, but self learning is not a bad option to try (if you are consistent enough, that is!). 
            lessons usually cost 15-40 NZD an hour, depending on the person. Guitar costs vary by a lot, as 
            there are various types too, such as classical, electric, acoustic, and sometimes variations such as 
            nylon acoustic. The range can go for long, ranging from approximately 200-1500 NZD for a decent guitar. But of course, 
            limited editions or old editions can cost much more than that! The recommended price is around 300-800 NZD. For guitars,
            maintenance is pretty limited unless you break a piece of the guitar. Optional 
            equipment to keep your guitar nice, can be equipment such as microfibre cloths,
            and lemon oil to keep your fretboard shiny and clean! These have minimal costs and 
            keep your guitar squeaky clean for a good while + doesn't need frequent
            rebuying ☻
